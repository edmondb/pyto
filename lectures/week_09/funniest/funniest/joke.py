This has been percolating in the back of my mind for a while.
It's a scene from _The Empire Strikes Back_ reinterpreted to serve
a valuable moral lesson for aspiring programmers.

EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- DAY
           With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of
        the many thick vines that grow in the swamp until he
        reaches the Dagobah statistics lab. Panting heavily, he
        continues his exercises -- grepping, installing new
        packages, logging in as root, and writing replacements for
        two-year-old shell scripts in Python.

YODA: Code!  Yes.  A programmer's strength flows from code
      maintainability.  But beware of Perl.  Terse syntax... more
      than one way to do it...  default variables.  The dark side
      of code maintainability are they.  Easily they flow, quick
      to join you when code you write.  If once you start down the
      dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume
      you it will.

LUKE: Is Perl better than Python?

YODA: No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, more seductive.

LUKE: But how will I know why Python is better than Perl?

YODA: You will know.  When your code you try to read six months
      from now.''')
